# stock-analysis
### Overview of Project
First, I refactored, the Stock Market Dataset with VBA solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect an entire dataset. Second, determine whether refactoring code successfully made the VBA script run faster. we just want to make the code more efficient by taking fewer steps, using less memory and improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.
### Results
Run the stock analysis, to confirm that our stock analysis outputs for 2017 and 2018 are the same as dataset example provided in the images below. Furthermore, in the resources folder and below you can see the final Stock Analysis Results named, VBA_Challenge with pop-up messages showing elapsed run time for the refactored code as VBA_Challenge_2017.png and VBA_Challenge_2018.png.<br>
As you can see in the images the stock market had more positive performance in 2017 then 2018.

### Summary
**What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?**

- The advantages of refactoring code is your codes runs in less time, it's clear and easy for other developers to read and understand your code, you can find the error easily.
- the disadvantages of refactoring code is first you have to go through all the code and understand its logic so you can refactor the code which is time consuming.

**How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**

A clean and well-organized code is always easy to change, easy to understand, and easy to maintain. You can avoid facing difficulty later if you pay attention to the code refactoring process earlier.
